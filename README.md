# advent-of-node-2023

AoC 2023 solutions using Node.js

## Getting Started

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:accuRx/advent-of-node-2023.git && cd advent-of-node-2023
$ git checkout -b <your-own-branch-name>
```

## Doing an exercise

On the days exercise, to get set up you can run

```shell
$ npm run day 1 # <- or whichever days exercise you're doing
```

This will create a directory named `day-1`, which will include an `puzzle.js` for you
to fill out with your solution, and the input for the puzzle will have been downloaded
for you (to an `input.txt` file).

To run your solution to the puzzle, run

```shell
$ node day-1
```
